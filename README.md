# tp-multipliable

Hi coders, today you will need to write a function `multipliable` that will take 3 STRING arguments, like this `'AB', 'AB', '100'`, where letters A...Z will represent unique single-digit number 0...9, and will need to return whether multiplying those composed numbers will give you a result.

For example,
```
multipliable('AB', 'AB', '100'); // true

// because 10 * 10 === 100
```

# tp-multipliable

Hi coders, today you will have to determine if 'AB' multiply by 'CD' will be equal to some number I'll provide! You will need to write a function `multipliable` that will take 3 STRING arguments, like this `'AB', 'BA', '99'`, where letters A...Z will represent unique single-digit number 0...9 and I'll repeat unique (`A !== B`)!
